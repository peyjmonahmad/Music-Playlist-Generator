I've got so much more to do And, Proof, I'm truly sorry if I let you down, but this tore me in two  The thought of no more me and you You gave me shoes, Nikes like new for me for school Doody, I'm trying, but you, you were the glue that binded So many things-time, I'd give anything to rewind it  I had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded By pictures all on my walls and I couldn't sleep at night 'cause That image burned in my brain of you on that table Me falling across your body, not able to stand to save you  God, why did you take him? I'm tryna keep his legacy alive, but I'm dying, where's Nathan? Little ladies, be brave, take care of your mother Smile pretty for pictures, always cherish each other  I'll always love ya and I'll be in the back of your memory And I know you'll never forget me Just don't get sad when remembering And, little bro, keep making me proud You better marry that girl 'cause she's faithfully down  And when you're exchanging those sacred vows Just know that if I could be there, I would And should you ever see parenthood, I know you'll be good at it Oh, almost forgot to do something, thank my father too I actually learned a lot from you You taught me what not to do  And, Mom, wish I'd have had the chance To have one last heart-to-heart honest and open talk with you Doody, I see you, I go to walk to you And I can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room  Nurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out Then the sheet over my head, shut the room down Girls, please don't get upset I see them cheeks soaking and wet As you squeeze hold of my neck, so forcibly, don't wanna let  Me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks With every second, each closer to death But suddenly I feel my heart begin to beat slow Then a breath, machines go Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit  I'm tryna rewind time like a tape Find an escape, make a beeline, try and awake From this dream, I need to re-find my inner strength To remind me, even if a steep climb I must take To rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape  Part II: Castle Extended  (I don't want it) I'll put out this last album, then I'm done with it One hundred percent finished, fed up with it I'm hanging it up, fuck it! Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold  And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't I'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet Shred these old letters I wrote All that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll I'm proud to be back  I'm 'bout to, like a rematch, outdo Relapse With Recovery, Mathers LP2 Help propel me to victory laps Gas toward 'em and fast forward the past Consider the last four minutes as  The song I'da sang to my daughters If I'da made it to the hospital less than two hours later, but I fought it And came back like a boomerang on 'em Now a new day is dawnin' I'm up, Tuesday, it's mornin'-now I know\",\n",

For turning your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift A Freudian slip Subconsciously, I honestly wished I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none of this Wish I had words  But I guess they're just ownin' for this Still, my point is I just can't say how sorry I am This is not how I planned for our story to end I love all of you, men But I just can't be the guy Everybody depends on for entire careers 'Cause that's not even fair I will always be here But that spark isn't there And I don't know how to recapture that time and that air I've tried hearkening back to But I'm fighting for air I'm barely charting myself Feels like I'm under the sink  But it was not my intent To treat y'all like a stepping stone Though I ain't left no one behind But we been down every road Done all we possibly can I know we kept up our hopes But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live The less is left for closure, so let's let this go It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over  I'ma wash away my sins I'ma rinse away this dirt I forgot to make amends To all the friends I may have hurt I better stop and say my grace From that I pray that I don't fall 'Cause on the way back down I may May end up running back into them all I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones\",\n",
